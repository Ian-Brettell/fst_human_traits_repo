# Differences in *Fst* across human traits

How do *Fst* distributions differ across human quantitative traits? Which ones show evidence of recent selection, and which ones do not? 

We investigate the differences in *Fst* distributions between GWAS SNP hits for diverse human traits including height, educational attainment, IBD, and skin colour, using the 1000 Genomes dataset.
